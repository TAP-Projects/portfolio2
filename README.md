# Julian Johannesen: Full-Stack Web Developer

Welcome to my portfolio site! Here you'll learn a little bit about me, and get to look at some of my recent work.

The site is deployed on Heroku here: https://jj-portfolio-2.herokuapp.com/

Please note that this site was created in part to fullfil a requirement of Treehouse's Talent Path Program.

## What is this?

Julian Johannesen: Full-Stack Web Developer is a my portfolio site. It was built using Node with Express on the back-end, and Foundation on the front-end. 

## Running Locally

Clone or download the project to your local development environment. From within the project directory, run:

```js
npm install
```

To start the development server, run:

```js
npm run devstart
```

This will spin up a local server at port 3000.
